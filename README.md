# find_in_dashlane_alfred_workflow
# Made little improvement from [this version](https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/7228-dashlane-workflow/).


My version will not start search untill the dashlane is in foreground. For the old version, if the mac is in heavy load, the search may fail.

You can [Download workflow](https://github.com/rockkoca/find_in_dashlane_alfred_workflow/raw/master/Find%20in%20Dashlane.alfredworkflow) here.
